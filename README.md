# Getting Started

To get started with the app, you will need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your machine. You can download Node.js from the **[official website](https://nodejs.org/en/)** and MongoDB from the [official website](https://www.mongodb.com/).

Once you have Node.js and MongoDB installed, you can follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Install the dependencies for both the front-end and back-end by `running npm` install in their respective directories.

Start the back-end by running `npm run dev` in the `backend` directory. This will start the server at `http://localhost:5000`.

Start the front-end by running `npm start` in the `frontend` directory. This will start the React app at `http://localhost:3000`.
